#### What I did:
1. Continued learning the fundamentals of CSS
2. Picked up implemention of a reusable navigation bar that I had started earlier using React and CSS; live link to that [mini-project here](https://reusable-react-nav-bar.netlify.app/ "NavBar") and link to Github repo [here](https://github.com/GithakaMbui/reusable-react-nav-bar "Github repo")
