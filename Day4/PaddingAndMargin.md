**Padding, Border and Margin**

A lot of people myself included have trouble remembering the difference between padding and Margin

### Analogies to help you:

##### Analogy 1
**Padding** is the weight/fat that you have added during the covid lockdown

**Border** is your skin

**Margin** is your social distance between other meat suits

#### Analogy 2
**Padding** is inside the border of content

**Margin** is outside it

If your content is touching the border or too close to it, **add padding**, if you want to give that box of content and adjacent content some spacing **add margin**
